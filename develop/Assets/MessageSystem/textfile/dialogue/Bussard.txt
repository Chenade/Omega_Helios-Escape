Current planet: Neptune         Target engine: Interstellar ram thruster (Bussard)[r][r]

Coming to Neptune, preparing to try to leave the solar system, you need a source of continuous energy, [r]
If the Bassad ram thruster is used, [r]
It can collect trace amounts of hydrogen and hydrogen ions in interstellar space as a source of energy for nuclear fusion. [w]


Interstellar ram thruster [r]
It is a thruster with nuclear fusion as the core concept of power [lr]
Improved from Bassad ram thruster [w]

The main concept of the Bassard ram thruster is to use a magnetic field to collect nuclear fusion materials and then react[lr]
However, the raw materials (deuterium, tritium) currently used by humans for nuclear fusion are too low in density to collect in the universe[r]
So improved the interstellar ram thruster[w]

The same is to use a magnetic field to collect nuclear fusion materials[r]
In this scheme, the collected hydrogen atoms and ions are used as part of the reaction materials [lr]
(Hydrogen atoms and ions have higher density in the universe) [w]

Reduce the energy of the proton beam (hydrogen nucleus) to 1 million electron volts [r]
Use them to bombard targets made of lithium-6 or boron-11 [lr]
(Compared with hydrogen and hydrogen, the fusion of lithium or boron and protons is easy to occur and the energy released is huge) [w]

When the spacecraft using the interstellar ramjet is about to reach its destination and needs to slow down [r]
Just turn on the magnetic field without starting the engine [r]
You can use the resistance formed by the magnetic field to slow down [lr]

Because the spacecraft of the interstellar ram thruster needs to reach 6% of the speed of light to collect enough materials to continue flying [lr]
So in the process of deceleration, collect raw materials for use when the speed of light is below 6% [w]

The biggest problem with this kind of engine at present is that it needs to reach the speed of light above 6% before it can be used smoothly [lr]
In addition, the technology of controllable nuclear fusion is also a big problem[w]


Currently necessary parts are scattered all over the planet[r]
Next, all you have to do is to collect the parts of the engine[r]
There may be difficulties in the process, and your ingenuity is needed! [w]
