Current Planet: Jupiter         Target Engine: Mass Drive [r][r]

There are many satellites around Jupiter, we are going to build a very large launch orbit on Europa, [r]
And with the surrounding satellites and the most massive Jupiter as a gravity slingshot, [r]
Shoot the spaceship further away. [w]

Mass projector, generally refers to a device that accelerates an object by the force of an electromagnetic field [lr]
In principle, it can be roughly divided into two types: Railgun and Coilgun. [w]

The railgun uses the principle of Lorentz force to accelerate the conductor projectile by the electrified rail; [r]
The coil gun uses an energized coil to generate a magnetic field to accelerate a magnetic projectile. [w]
Devices that use electromagnetic force to eject have many applications in reality, such as maglev trains, aircraft ejection devices on aircraft carriers, [r]
In recent years, the United States and China have also developed magnetic rail guns installed on ships, which can directly use electrical energy to launch ultra-high-speed artillery shells. [w]

Using electromagnetic force projection as a launch device for spacecraft, NASA once proposed such an idea, but there are many obstacles to development at this stage:[w]
Regardless of whether it is a coil gun or a magnetic rail gun, it requires extremely large electric energy; [lr]
In the process of launching, there will be a lot of energy lost as heat energy, and even lead to a low life of the equipment; [lr]
In addition, the G force that humans can bear is limited, and the maximum cannot exceed 9G, which makes the acceleration distance at least nearly 400 kilometers, and it is impossible to implement such a long launch track in construction. [w]
In other words, if we want to develop a spacecraft electromagnetic launching device that can be actually used, [r]
The following shortcomings must be overcome: [lr]
A huge source of energy, the construction of a huge orbit, and how to reduce the G force generated by acceleration. [w]



Currently necessary parts are scattered all over the planet[r]
Next, all you have to do is to collect the parts of the engine[r]
There may be difficulties in the process, and your ingenuity is needed! [w]
