Current Planet: Uranus           Target Engine: Nuclear Propulsion (NEMP)[r][r]

Came to Uranus, where the energy from the sun is no longer available, and resources are scarce, [r]
Therefore, the closer it is to the sun, the more suitable it is.
We also need to collect some materials for cooling on the cold Uranus! [w]


Nuclear pulse propulsion[r]
A space flight thruster that uses a nuclear explosion as thrust [lr]
The main materials are uranium-235 and plutonium-239[w]

Nuclear pulse spacecraft uses nuclear fission as a driving energy source[lr]
The splitting energy comes from the release of neutrons and protons when the nucleus decomposes [r]
And generate a lot of gamma ray energy [w]

Because the nuclear pulse propulsion at the tail of the spacecraft requires the impact of the big bang [r]
So a large thick metal plate is needed to absorb the impact of the explosion[r]
And a series of shock wave absorbers to isolate the crew from the aftershocks after the explosion. [w]

The material to isolate the shock wave and the raw materials of the nuclear material will make the spacecraft very bulky [lr]
If it’s not for the energy source is very powerful [r]
The nuclear fission spacecraft will be slower than the solar sail [w]


In theory, nuclear pulse propulsion can reach 5~10% of the speed of light [lr]
It can allow humans to reach the star closest to the solar system within 40 years [r]
And it's completely feasible in theory [w]

But [r]
Flying with a bunch of atomic bombs behind [lr]
It’s really something that needs to be considered [w]



Currently necessary parts are scattered all over the planet[r]
Next, all you have to do is to collect the parts of the engine[r]
There may be difficulties in the process, and your ingenuity is needed! [w]
